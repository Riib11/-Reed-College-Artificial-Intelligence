# Project 3: Reinforcement Learning

*Important*: For question 4 and 5, it seems that the project expected us to implement 'greedy epsilon' and not in the same file. I couldn't find a way to do this without some sort of toggle. So:

- when testing question 4, set `GREEDY = False` at the top of `qLearningAgents.py`
- when testing quetsion 5, set `GREEDY = True` at the top of `qLearningAgents.py`
